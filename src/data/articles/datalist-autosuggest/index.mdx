## Table of Contents

## Use Case

For a search feature, we're storing the 100 most recently used ("MRU") search
terms. In the search box, we want to auto suggest based on the MRU terms, but
not restrict the input to just those terms.

<Search client:idle />

## Solution: HTML `<datalist>`

Until recently, I didn't know about the [`<datalist>`][datalist] element until
I read [Peter Bengtsson's article][peter]. [According to MDN][datalist]:

> The HTML `<datalist>` element contains a set of `<option>` elements that
> represent the permissible or recommended options available to choose from
> within other controls.

Sounds exactly like what we need.

### Version 1

Let's start with a basic implementation:

```js {1-2,4-8,18-19,26-30}
const [term, setTerm] = React.useState("");
const [mruTerms, setMruTerms] = React.useState([]);

React.useEffect(() => {
  fetch("https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?number=100")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => setMruTerms(data));
}, []);

return (
  <main>
    <form
      autoComplete="off"
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const term = e.currentTarget.term.value;
        if (term.trim() !== "") {
          setTerm(term.trim());
          setMruTerms([...new Set([term.trim(), ...mruTerms])].slice(0, 100));
        }
      }}
    >
      <label htmlFor="term">Search term</label>
      <input list="mru-terms" id="term" name="term" />

      <datalist id="mru-terms" key={term}>
        {mruTerms.map((term) => (
          <option key={term} value={term} />
        ))}
      </datalist>

      <button>Search</button>
    </form>

    <p>Submitted term: {term}</p>
  </main>
);
```

1. We keep track of two pieces of context data: what the user submits (`term`),
   and the list of MRU terms (`mruTerms`).
1. We initialize `mruTerms` when the component is first rendered. In a real
   app, this can be fetched from a service, upstream app state, or
   `localStorage`.
1. `<option>` elements of the `<datalist>` are generated from `mruTerms`.
   Notice the entire `<datalist>` component is replaced every time `term`
   changes since we bind it to the `key` prop.
   - This approach effectively links the `mruTerms` update cycle to changes in
     `term`, as a new array is generated whenever `term` changes.
   - As a bonus, this also works around a longstanding [Firefox bug][] with
     dynamic datalists.
1. Each time the user performs a search, both `term` and `mruTerms` are updated
   (and persisted in a real app).

### Version 2

With very little code, our autosuggest feature already works pretty well. Let's
refactor our code so all context data is handled within a single object:

```js {2,15}
const useInitialize = () => {
  const [{ term, mruTerms }, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialData);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?number=100")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((payload) => dispatch({ type: "init", payload }));
  }, []);

  const actions = {
    updateTerm: (payload) => dispatch({ type: "updateTerm", payload }),
  };
  return { term, mruTerms, actions };
};

const initialData = { term: "", mruTerms: [] };

const reducer = (data, { type, payload }) => {
  const { term, mruTerms } = data;
  switch (type) {
    case "init":
      return { term, mruTerms: payload };
    case "updateTerm":
      if (payload.trim() === "") return data;
      return {
        term: payload.trim(),
        mruTerms: [...new Set([payload.trim(), ...mruTerms])].slice(0, 100),
      };
    default:
      return data;
  }
};
```

1. Instead of multiple `useState`s, we consolidate into a single `useReducer`.
1. We move most of the business logic into a custom hook, simplifying the
   actual component.

<CodeSandbox
  client:idle
  id="datalist-autosuggest-v2-rutk0"
  title="v2 demo of datalist"
  heading={{ component: "h4" }}
/>

### Version 3

For our purposes, the search terms "ice cream", "Ice Cream", and " ICE CREAM "
are all considered equivalents. We want to store the last version used (minus
the surrounding spaces) without duplicates in `mruTerms`.

Let's create a couple of helper functions first:

```js
const addMruTerm = (mruTerms, term) =>
  [term, ...mruTerms]
    .reduce(
      (unique, item) =>
        unique.some((e) => trimLower(e) === trimLower(item))
          ? unique
          : [...unique, item.trim()],
      [],
    )
    .slice(0, 100);

const trimLower = (term) => term.trim().toLowerCase();
```

Then we change how we update `mruTerms` in the reducer:

```js
mruTerms: addMruTerm(mruTerms, payload);
```

<CodeSandbox
  client:idle
  id="datalist-autosuggest-v3-hc8hr"
  title="v3 demo of datalist"
  heading={{ component: "h4" }}
/>

### Version 4

Our autosuggest feature is starting to work nicely. You'll notice that Chrome
and Firefox sort suggestions in the `mruTerms` array order. I think a better
experience would be to sort by three major sections. For example, if the search
term is "cr":

1. First, suggestions that begin with the current search term, e.g.
   "==cr==anial", "==cr==eamery".
1. Next, suggestions that contain words that start with the current search,
   e.g. "heavy ==cr==ate", "ice ==cr==eam".
1. Finally, suggestions that contain the search term, anywhere, e.g.
   "dis==cr==eet", "s==cr==ibe".

Within each section, we can further sort alphabetically.

In order to accomplish this, we need to update `<datalist>` as we type the
search term. This means we need to keep track of a couple of additional pieces
of context data: `draft` and `sortedMruTerms`:

```js
const initialData = { draft: "", term: "", mruTerms: [], sortedMruTerms: [] };
```

We also add another helper function `sortMruTerms`, and adjust the `reducer`
accordingly:

```js {4-18,24}
const reducer = (data, { type, payload }) => {
  const { draft, mruTerms } = data;
  switch (type) {
    case "init":
      return { ...data, mruTerms: payload, sortedMruTerms: payload };
    case "updateDraft":
      return {
        ...data,
        draft: payload,
        sortedMruTerms: sortMruTerms(mruTerms, payload),
      };
    case "updateTerm":
      if (draft.trim() === "") return data;
      return {
        ...data,
        term: draft.trim(),
        mruTerms: addMruTerm(mruTerms, draft),
      };
    default:
      return data;
  }
};

const sortMruTerms = (mruTerms, term) => {
  const partial = trimLower(term);
  if (partial === "") return mruTerms;

  let terms = [...mruTerms];
  let sorted = [];

  sortFilters(partial).forEach((filter) => {
    sorted = [...sorted, ...terms.filter(filter).sort()];
    terms = terms.filter((t) => !sorted.includes(t));
  });

  return sorted;
};

const sortFilters = (partial) => [
  (t) => trimLower(t).startsWith(partial),
  (t) => RegExp(`\\b${partial}`, "i").test(t),
  (t) => RegExp(partial, "i").test(t),
];
```

1. Initialize `sortedMruTerms`.
1. Add action to handle `updateDraft`, which is called each time the search
   term changes.
1. `updateTerm` no longer requires a payload, since we can calculate new
   context values based on `draft`.
1. Minor adjustments are also needed in the custom hook to accommodate these
   changes.

Lastly, some minor adjustments in the JSX and we're done:

```js {2-3,9-10}
<input
  value={draft}
  onChange={(e) => actions.updateDraft(e.currentTarget.value)}
  list="mru-terms"
  id="term"
  name="term"
/>

<datalist id="mru-terms" key={draft}>
  {sortedMruTerms.map((term) => (
    <option key={term} value={term} />
  ))}
</datalist>
```

1. Convert the search term `<input>` into a controlled component, binding its
   value to `draft` and event handling to `updateDraft`.
1. `<datalist>` is now replaced every time `draft` changes, and its values come
   from `sortedMruTerms`.

<CodeSandbox
  client:idle
  id="datalist-autosuggest-v4-6ux86"
  title="v4 demo of datalist"
  heading={{ component: "h4" }}
/>

As you can see, by abstracting the logic out from the component, we can easily
tweak the behavior while minimizing changes to the component itself. We can
also test the utility functions independently. Composition FTW ðŸ™Œ.

Can you think of other improvements to this feature? Fork one of the
CodeSandboxes and see what you come up with.

## Accessibility

[Weston Thayer][] and I had a discussion about accessibility for the datalist
element. He pointed out the following issues and resources for further
investigation.

[There are potentially some accessibility issues][a11y] that may prevent you
from using this technique, specifically screen readers do not convey datalist
changes. This may be acceptable in the case of auto suggest, since the user is
free to enter whatever they likeâ€”the auto suggest feature is a nice-to-have.

For a React-specific alternative, [check out Reach UI's
Combobox][reach-ui-combobox]. Also [read 24 Accessibility's "&lt;select&gt;
Your Poison"][select-your-poision] article for an in-depth discussion of why
this is a hard-to-solve problem.

## Other Use Cases

It occurred to me that this technique can be used in situations where you want
to normalize data as much as possible, while still allowing the user to freely
enter anything they like.

[In a recent article](/articles/workplace-justice-ally), I talked about the
issue of HR asking for personal pronouns. HR would like the data to be as
consistent as possible, but the right thing to do is to allow people to enter
whatever they want. Here's a possible implementation that fulfills both
requirements:

## Takeaways

- For combo boxes, try the built-in `<datalist>` element first.
- You can dynamically generate the datalist options based on events.
- Abstract out as much logic as possible from your components for
  composability, testability, and agility.
