- [Part 1: Introduction to `useReducer` and basic reducer patterns][part-1]

[In part 1][part-1], we looked at reducer patterns that didn't use any
parameters or only used the current state to calculate the next state. We also
learned that <mark>the primary job of a reducer is to produce a new
state</mark>.

Let's continue exploring other reducer patterns.

## Reducer Using `action`

Remember that `(currentState, action) => newState` is the complete reducer
signature. In the patterns we've explored so far, we haven't used the `action`
parameter. We know the hook automatically supplies the current state to the
reducer, but how does a reducer receive its `action` parameter? It receives the
`action` parameter via the `dispatch` function returned by the hook: `[state,
dispatch] = useReducer(reducer)`. The `dispatch` function takes a single
optional parameter: `dispatch(action)`.

### Use Both `currentState` and `action` Parameters

Let's look at an example where we use both parameters with the `reducer`
function.

```js {1-2,6,11}
const reducer = (count, valueToAdd) => count + valueToAdd;
const [count, addToCount] = React.useReducer(reducer, 0);

return (
  <main>
    <div>Count: {count}</div>
    <form
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const valueToAdd = Number(e.currentTarget.numberToAdd.value);
        addToCount(valueToAdd);
      }}
    >
      <label>
        Add to count:{" "}
        <input
          name="numberToAdd"
          type="number"
          defaultValue={1}
          style={{ width: "4em" }}
        />
      </label>
      <button>Add</button>
    </form>
  </main>
);
```

What's happening? When we submit the form, we dispatch (`addToCount`) an action
(the value from `<input name="numberToAdd">`). The reducer takes the current
state (`count`) and the action (`valueToAdd`) to produce a new state (`count +
valueToAdd`).

Many examples of actions you've seen use the shape `{ type, payload }`. While
this is a common convention, <mark>an action can be anything you like</mark>
(including `undefined`). In this example, an action is simply a number.

<CodeSandbox
  client:idle
  id="reducer-pattern-021-x732b"
  title="reducer with state and action params"
  heading={{ component: "h4" }}
/>

### Use `action` Param Only

Just like how we can choose to only use the `currentState` param in a reducer,
we can choose to only use the `action` parameter.

```js {1-2,11}
const reducer = (_, newCount) => newCount;
const [count, setCount] = React.useReducer(reducer, 0);

return (
  <main>
    <div>Count: {count}</div>
    <form
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const valueToAdd = Number(e.currentTarget.numberToAdd.value);
        setCount(count + valueToAdd);
      }}
    >
      ...
    </form>
  </main>
);
```

By switching up a few lines, our `reducer` now only relies on the action
(`newCount`) to calculate its new state.

ðŸ¤” Wait a minute, that looks a lot like `React.useState`.

## Implement a Simple `useState`

Replace

```js
const reducer = (_, newCount) => newCount;
const [count, setCount] = React.useReducer(reducer, 0);
```

with

```js
const reducer = (_, newState) => newState;
const useState = (initialState) => React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

We have ourselves a simple `useState`! You can see that `React.useState` is
syntactic sugar for `React.useReducer`, simplifying the common use case of
updating a single state value. A complete re-implementation of `useState` is a
few more lines of code. [See Kent C. Dodd's "How to implement useState with
useReducer"][implement-usestate] if you're interested in an in-depth
explanation.

/>

## Implement a State Updater

### Use Case

We have a user profile form that allows users to change each value in the state
object.

### Solution

One elegant solution is to use the [object spread syntax][spread] to create the
next state.

```js {1,8,12,14,19}
const reducer = (info, updates) => ({ ...info, ...updates });
const initialValue = {
  name: "Pat Doe",
  twitter: "@pdough",
  email: "pat@pdough.me",
  website: "https://pdough.me",
};
const [info, update] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialValue);

return (
  <main>
    <pre>{JSON.stringify(info, null, 2)}</pre>
    <form>
      {Object.entries(info).map(([key, value]) => (
        <label key={key} style={{ display: "block" }}>
          {key}:{" "}
          <input
            value={value}
            onChange={(e) => update({ [key]: e.currentTarget.value })}
          />
        </label>
      ))}
    </form>
  </main>
);
```

  client:idle
  id="reducer-pattern-035-lysww"
  title="simple state updater"
  heading={{ component: "h4" }}
/>

## Dispatch Functions as Actions

Wait, say what? ðŸ¤”

```js {1-4,8,21,27}
const reducer = (count, action) => action(count);
const [count, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, 0);
const add = (value) => dispatch((count) => count + value);
const subtract = (value) => dispatch((count) => count - value);

return (
  <main>
    <div>Count: {count}</div>
    <form>
      <label>
        Change count by:{" "}
        <input
          name="modifier"
          type="number"
          defaultValue={1}
          style={{ width: "4em" }}
        />
      </label>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={(e) => add(Number(e.currentTarget.form.modifier.value))}
      >
        Add
      </button>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={(e) => subtract(Number(e.currentTarget.form.modifier.value))}
      >
        Subtract
      </button>
    </form>
  </main>
);
```

Yup, as stated earlier, <mark>an action can be anything you like</mark>. In this
example, we're dispatching callback functions! ðŸ¤¯

## Takeaways

- Dispatched actions can take any shape you want: `undefined`, a value, an
  object, or even a function.
- The `action` parameter is the value shared between the `dispatch()` and
  `reducer()` functions, acting as their private contract.
- React.useState is syntactic sugar for one specific use case of
  React.useReducer.

## Intermission

You can implement a reducer in any way you like, as long as it fulfills the
contract of `([currentState], [action]) => newState`. You have complete freedom
in deciding what an action looks like, and how you want to calculate the new
state.

We've explored different ways of writing the reducer function, and we haven't
even come across the familiar `switch` statement yet. Don't worry, we'll get to
that in [part 3][part-3].
