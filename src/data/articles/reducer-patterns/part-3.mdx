- [Part 1: Introduction to `useReducer` and basic reducer patterns][part-1]
- [Part 2: Reducers with actions][part-2]

So far in parts 1 and 2 of this series, we've learned that:

- The primary job of a reducer is to produce a new state.
- Dispatched actions can take any shape you want.

In part 3, we'll look at the most common pattern for reducers and actions
you'll find in documentation and online examples, and we'll model a state chart
using a reducer.

## Typical `useReducer` Pattern

Most `React.useReducer` examples you encounter dispatch actions resembling `{
type, payload }`. Their reducer functions typically consist of a `switch`
statement that matches on `type` and uses `payload` to calculate the next
state.

Remember, the reducer signature is `(currentState, action) => nextState`. A
`switch`-statement-based reducer looks like this:

```js
const reducer = (count, { type, payload }) => {
  switch (type) {
    case "add":
      return count + payload;
    case "reset":
      return initialValue;
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};
```

To trigger this reducer, there are two possible actions we can dispatch.

```js
dispatch({ type: "add", payload: 5 });
dispatch({ type: "reset" });
```

We can encapsulate these two possibilities with [bound action
creators][action creators]:

```js
const add = (payload) => dispatch({ type: "add", payload });
const reset = () => dispatch({ type: "reset" });
```

Action creators are optional; you can dispatch actions directly where needed
instead. However, they offer a cleaner interface for the hook's user by hiding
the reducer's implementation details.

The complete `useReducer` definition looks like this:

```js
const initialValue = 0;
const reducer = (count, { type, payload }) => {
  switch (type) {
    case "add":
      return count + payload;
    case "reset":
      return initialValue;
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};

const [count, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialValue);

const add = (payload) => dispatch({ type: "add", payload });
const reset = () => dispatch({ type: "reset" });
```

Our hook interface is now `count`, plus the `add()` and `reset()` functions.

## Tightly Coupled State Values

So far, we've explored several reducer and action patterns, but we haven't
discussed _why_ we use `useReducer`. In fact, you can express the previous
example more clearly using a `useState` hook:

```js
const initialValue = 0;
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialValue);
const add = (value) => setCount(count + value);
const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);
```

<CodeSandbox
  client:idle
  id="reducer-pattern-041-1uptn"
  title="useReducer simplified with useState"
/>

`useState` is optimized for managing a single state value. This implies that
`useReducer` excels when we need to manage multiple related state values.

What if we want to add an undo function to retrieve previous counts? One way to
do this is to track the count history. Instead of only tracking the latest
count, our state object now looks like this:

```js
const initialState = { count: 0, history: [] };
```

We update the reducer with the following changes:

- Return the current state as-is if we add zero, since this action doesn't
  change the state.
- If we're adding any other value, also add the current `count` to the
  `history` stack.
- Add a new `case` to handle the `undo` action.

```js {5-6,9-12}
const reducer = (state, { type, payload }) => {
  const { count, history } = state;
  switch (type) {
    case "add":
      if (payload === 0) return state;
      return { count: count + payload, history: [...history, count] };
    case "reset":
      return initialState;
    case "undo":
      if (history.length === 0) return state;
      const lastCount = [...history].pop();
      return { count: lastCount, history: history.slice(0, -1) };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};
```

Lastly, we add another bound action creator to handle `undo()`:

```js
const undo = () => dispatch({ type: "undo" });
```

Putting it all together:

```js
const initialState = { count: 0, history: [] };

const reducer = (state, { type, payload }) => {
  const { count, history } = state;
  switch (type) {
    case "add":
      if (payload === 0) return state;
      return { count: count + payload, history: [...history, count] };
    case "reset":
      return initialState;
    case "undo":
      if (history.length === 0) return state;
      const lastCount = [...history].pop();
      return { count: lastCount, history: history.slice(0, -1) };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};

const [{ count, history }, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);

const add = (payload) => dispatch({ type: "add", payload });
const reset = () => dispatch({ type: "reset" });
const undo = () => dispatch({ type: "undo" });
```

We see that `count` and `history` are tightly coupled. When we add a value, we
update `count` and add the previous count to the `history` stack. When we undo,
we replace `count` by popping the last item from the `history` stack.

## Nested Switch Statements

Did you know you can nest a `switch` statement inside the `case` clause of
another `switch` statement? Using this technique, you can implement
sophisticated logic with the `useReducer` hook, especially when combined with
`useEffect`.

Let's create a seemingly simple form with a single input and a couple of
buttons:

- The input will only accept `[A-Za-z]` characters
- Submit button to POST the input value to an API
- Reset button to reset the input value to the last successful submission.

Simple, right? That's often how forms start, but complexity arises when you
consider:

- If input is invalid, display error message and don't allow submission.
- Don't allow submission if input value hasn't changed from the previous
  submission.
- During submission, disable all inputs.
- Display submission status.
- When a submission error occurs, the submit button should remain active to
  allow for retry.

How can you satisfy all these requirements? Should you try to capture all the
logic imperatively? Should you use one of the many React form libraries? I
believe [state charts][] offer a great way to declaratively satisfy all these
requirements.

  diagram={formStateDiagram}

Our state chart has four states—editing, submitting, resolved, rejected—with
clear transitions defined among the states, e.g. we transition from `editing` to
`submitting` state by performing the `submit` action.

### Initial Hook State

First, let's define what our `useReducer` hook state looks like. Note that the
hook's state is distinct from the state chart's state. Our hook state looks
like this:

```js
const initialState = {
  value: "editing",

  context: {
    previousValue: "",
    value: "",
    isValid: true,
    submitAllowed: false,
    isSuccessful: undefined,
  },
};
```

The `value` property holds our state chart's current state. We also have a
separate `context` property that tracks the [extended state][].

### Translate a State Chart to a Reducer Function

```js {3-8, 35-37} collapse={15-32, 39-42, 46-54, 57-63}
const reducer = (state, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  const { value, context } = state;
  // Top-level switch based on the state chart's current state (state.value)
  switch (value) {
    case "editing":
      // Nested switch based on the action type (transition)
      switch (type) {
        case "change":
          const isValid = /^[A-Za-z]*$/.test(payload);
          const submitAllowed = isValid && context.previousValue !== payload;
          return {
            value,
            context: { ...context, value: payload, isValid, submitAllowed },
          };

        case "reset":
          return {
            value,
            context: {
              ...context,
              value: context.previousValue,
              isValid: true,
              submitAllowed: false,
            },
          };

        case "submit":
          if (context.submitAllowed) return { value: "submitting", context };
          return state;

        default:
          return state;
      }

    case "submitting":
      switch (type) {
        case "resolve":
          return { value: "resolved", context };
        case "reject":
          return { value: "rejected", context };
        default:
          return state;
      }

    case "resolved":
      return {
        value: "editing",
        context: {
          ...context,
          previousValue: context.value,
          isSuccessful: true,
          submitAllowed: false,
        },
      };

    case "rejected":
      return {
        value: "editing",
        context: {
          ...context,
          isSuccessful: false,
        },
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

Notice the top-level `switch` statement evaluates the `state.value` (the state
chart's current state). For the `editing` and `submitting` states, we use a
nested `switch` based on `action.type` (representing the state chart
transition). Why is this done? This guarantees that, for example, the `submit`
transition is only valid when the state chart is in the `editing` state.
Practically, this means that if the form is already in the `submitting` state,
it cannot be submitted again, regardless of user actions (solving the multiple
button click issue, even if the submit button isn't explicitly disabled).

If you compare the code to the diagram, you'll see that each `case` clause
corresponds to a transition—seven transitions mean seven `case` clauses that
return the next state.

Notice that the `default` clauses always return the original state unmodified.
This aligns with how state machines typically work: attempting an invalid
transition leaves the state unchanged.

Looking at each `case` clause, you'll notice we're performing a couple of
tasks:

1. Specify the next state by changing `state.value`.
1. Changing `state.context` as appropriate for a given transition.

### Putting It All Together

```js
const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
const transitions = {
  change: (payload) => dispatch({ type: "change", payload }),
  reset: () => dispatch({ type: "reset" }),
  submit: () => dispatch({ type: "submit" }),
};
```

To trigger transitions, we use the `dispatch()` function returned by the
`useReducer` hook. Transitions can be triggered manually (e.g., by a user
clicking a button) via event handlers, or automatically (e.g., when state
changes) via `useEffect`.

Discussing complex state chart topics in depth is beyond the scope of this
article. What we're demonstrating here is that you can model fairly complex
systems using reducers, if somewhat awkwardly.

## Takeaways

- Use `React.useReducer` when you need to manage multiple tightly-coupled state
  values.
- Reducers are capable of modeling complex systems.
- Consider making your `useReducer` hook more user-friendly by providing action
  creators.

As demonstrated in this series, `useReducer` is a hook pattern capable of
solving a wide variety of problems, from simple to moderately complex. Now that
the potentially intimidating aspect of the pattern (reducers) is hopefully less
daunting, I encourage you to use `useReducer` more frequently and creatively.
