  object destructuring and rest syntax. This method ensures immutability while
  simplifying the removal of unwanted properties.

## Use Case

Suppose you have a JavaScript object received from a source (e.g., retrieved
from an API):

```js
const restaurant = {
  name: "Nong's Khao Man Gai",
  address: "609 SE Ankeny St",
  phone: "503-740-2907",
  secretKeyLocation: "somewhere",
};
```

You want to remove `secretKeyLocation` before passing the object on to the next
part of the workflow.

## Solution: Remove Property Using Destructuring + Rest Syntax

Use a combination of [object destructuring][destructure] and [object literal
spread/rest syntax][spread].

```js {1}
const { secretKeyLocation, ...rest } = restaurant;
doSomethingWith(rest);
```

With this, you now have three variables:

- `secretKeyLocation` with the value of `"somewhere"`
- `rest`, a new object with the `secretKeyLocation` property removed:

  ```js
  {
    name: "Nong's Khao Man Gai",
    address: "609 SE Ankeny St",
    phone: "503-740-2907",
  }
  ```

  It's worth noting that `rest` can be any valid variable name; the name `rest`
  itself has no special meaning.

- `restaurant` remains untouched and retains its original value. Immutability
  FTW ðŸ™Œ!
