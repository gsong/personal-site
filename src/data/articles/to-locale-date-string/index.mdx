  Format dates in JavaScript efficiently with `toLocaleDateString()`—no extra
  libraries required!
summary: >
  Learn how to format dates in JavaScript using the built-in `Date` object and
  `toLocaleDateString()` method. This method offers a lightweight alternative
  to libraries like Moment.js or date-fns for basic date formatting needs.

import { CodeSandbox } from "@/components/CodeSandbox";

import { LocaleDate } from "./LocaleDate";

export const isoDate = new Date().toISOString();

Do you automatically reach for [Moment.js][] when you need to format dates? Or
perhaps you prefer [date-fns][]? But if you have basic formatting needs, don't
discount the built-in JavaScript tools.

## Use Case

I'm displaying a date with each article on this site. The source of the date is
an [ISO date string][iso-8601], which looks like <code>{isoDate}</code>. This
is a typical format you'll receive as part of an API response, for example.

While the ISO format is explicit and great for cross-boundary data exchange,
it's not display-friendly. Let's show a localized date string instead.

<LocaleDate client:idle />

## Solution

1. [Parse the ISO date string][date-constructor]

   ```js
   const isoDateString = "2020-07-10T14:16:40.463Z";
   const date = new Date(isoDateString);
   ```

1. [Get the browser locale][navigator.language]

   ```js
   const locale = typeof window === "undefined" ? "en" : navigator.language;
   ```

   If we're not in a browser environment (`window === "undefined"`), default to English.

1. [Format the date][tolocaledatestring]

   ```js
   const formattedDate = date.toLocaleDateString(locale, {
     year: "numeric",
     month: "long",
     day: "numeric",
   });
   ```

   [See the `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` constructor][intl-params] for details on
   the parameters.

It's a bit more code than using one of the libraries, but your users will thank
you for the smaller bundle size.

OK, they probably won't—but you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you've done
your part to improve their experience.
