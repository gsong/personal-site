  Format dates in JavaScript efficiently with `toLocaleDateString()`—no extra
  libraries required!
summary: >-
  Learn how to format dates in JavaScript using the built-in `Date` object and
  `toLocaleDateString()` method. This method offers a lightweight alternative
  to libraries like Moment.js or date-fns for basic date formatting needs.

import { CodeSandbox } from "@/components/CodeSandbox";

import { LocaleDate } from "./LocaleDate";

export const isoDate = new Date().toISOString();

Do you automatically reach for [Moment.js][] or [date-fns][] when formatting
dates? For basic needs, consider the built-in JavaScript tools instead.

## Use Case

I'm displaying a date with each article on this site. The source of the date is
an [ISO date string][iso-8601], which looks like <code>{isoDate}</code>. This
is a common format you'll receive from APIs.

While ISO format is excellent for data exchange, it's not user-friendly for
display. Let's localize it instead.

<LocaleDate client:idle />

## Solution

1. [Parse the ISO date string][date-constructor]

   ```js
   const isoDateString = "2020-07-10T14:16:40.463Z";
   const date = new Date(isoDateString);
   ```

1. [Get the browser locale][navigator.language]

   ```js
   const locale = typeof window === "undefined" ? "en" : navigator.language;
   ```

   If we're not in a browser environment (like during SSR), default to English.

1. [Format the date][tolocaledatestring]

   ```js
   const formattedDate = date.toLocaleDateString(locale, {
     year: "numeric",
     month: "long",
     day: "numeric",
   });
   ```

   [See the `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` constructor][intl-params] for details on
   the parameters.

It's a bit more code than using one of the libraries, but your users will thank
you for the smaller bundle size.

OK, they probably won't—but you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you've done
your part to improve their experience.
